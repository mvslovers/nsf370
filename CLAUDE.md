# CLAUDE.md — NSF (mvs38j-ip revival)

> Operational guide for any Claude Code session working in this repository.

> Specification and any ADRs it references, before writing code.**

NSF ("Network Services Facility") is an **event-driven networking subsystem
for MVS 3.8j** whose first responsibility is a native TCP/IP stack. It is a
from-scratch revival of the abandoned `mvs38j-ip` project — **not** a port of
its Xinu code (see ADR-0005). Goal: run existing applications (HTTPD, mvsMF)
**unchanged, relink-only** over a native stack instead of the Hercules X'75'
hack, with full EZASOKET / PROFILE.TCPIP compatibility.

## 2. Architecture in One Screen

One executive task runs a single event loop, run-to-completion, no preemption
inside the stack. Async MVS exits (device I/O, timer) do the minimum — enqueue
a pre-allocated element (CS) and POST an ECB — everything real happens later on
the executive task.

```
Applications ─ EZASOKET (NSFEZA) ─ Request Mgr (NSFREQ) ─ Sockets (NSFSOC)
                                                          │
                         TCP (NSFTCP) · UDP (NSFUDP) · IPv4/ICMP (NSFIP/NSFICM)
                                                          │
                    Device abstraction (NSFDEV) ─ CTCI / LCS / HOST drivers
   Foundation (used by all): NSFMM NSFBUF NSFQUE NSFTMR NSFEVT NSFTRC NSFSTS
```

**Two phases, one contract.** Phase 1: stack runs in-process (ATTACHed
subtask) — trivial debugging. Phase 2: own STC as subsystem `NSFS`
(SSI/cross-memory). The `NSFRQE` request block is the phase boundary; only the
transport changes, never the request format.

---

## 3. Non-Negotiable Invariants

These are the rules that keep the system correct on a 24-bit, 16 MB machine.
Violating one is a review-blocking defect, not a style nit.

**Memory**
- Protocol code never calls `GETMAIN` / `malloc` / any storage service.
  **Only `NSFMM` owns storage.** `mm_pool_create` is init-time only (it
  ABENDs if called later — the rule is enforced, not documented).
- `mm_alloc()` returning `NULL` is **normal and expected**. Every caller
  handles it gracefully (drop packet + count, reject connection, fail API with
  `ENOBUFS`). Exhaustion is never an ABEND.
- Every control block declares its byte size and is guarded by
  `NSF_SIZE_ASSERT(type, size)`.

**Buffers (PBUF)**
- **Single owner, no reference counting.** A function either *keeps* a PBUF or
  *passes it on* — never both, never neither. Each interface states which.
- **Only the executive task frees buffers.** Exits queue them for freeing.

**Execution**
- Event handlers **never** WAIT, **never** loop over unbounded input, **never**
  call `mm_pool_create`. Run-to-completion. The loop enforces a drain budget so
  a flood cannot starve timers.
- All mainline state is single-task — **no locking** except the CS-based
  exit→mainline handoff (`xq_push`) and POST.
- Queues are **bounded** by default (socket rx, listen backlog, device send);
  reject rather than grow.

**Timers**
- `TMR` structures are **embedded** in their owner CB (never allocated).
  Arming cannot fail.
- `tmr_cancel` is idempotent and **mandatory in every teardown path**.

**Lifetime / teardown**
- Every object dies through **exactly one** destroy function with a full
  checklist (`soc_destroy`, `tcp_destroy`, device quiesce). Never tear down ad
  hoc. This is the direct defense against the resource-leak / secondary-ABEND
  class of bug.

**Recovery**
- The executive task runs under **ESTAE from M0 onward**. The recovery path
  calls the same destroy/quiesce functions as the orderly path. A crash must
  never require a Hercules restart to clean up.

**Compatibility & scope**
- Sockets are **binary-transparent**: NSF never converts payload between EBCDIC
  and ASCII (application's job, like IBM). NSF only converts its own text
  (config, operator messages, trace, later DNS names).
- **v1 does not fragment or reassemble IP.** Inbound fragments are dropped and
  counted; transports respect MTU (TCP MSS, UDP `EMSGSIZE`).
- **No Xinu code.** Fresh implementation from RFC/IBM docs.

**External symbols**
- cc370/ld370 fold every external name to **8 characters** after upcasing and
  mapping `_` → `@`. On a collision ld370 keeps one definition **silently**, so
  two C functions that agree in the first 8 mangled characters bind to the *same*
  code — a wrong-function dispatch that only bites on MVS (native host builds
  have no 8-char limit and never see it; e.g. `buf_trim_head`/`buf_trim_tail` →
  `BUF@TRIM`, `nsf_abend`/`nsf_abend_sethook` → `NSF@ABEN`).
- Therefore **every cross-module (non-`static`) NSF C function carries an
  explicit 8-char uppercase `asm("XXXXXXXX")` alias on its declaration in the
  header**, unique across the whole load module, on a per-component scheme
  (`NSFB*` buffers, `NSFM*` memory, `NSFQ*` queue, `NSFTR*` trace, `NSFST*`
  stats, `NSFA*` abend, `NSFX*` xq, plus `NSFNOW`/`NSFTASK` for the time seam).
  Each header lists its aliases in a comment block. **Never rely on cc370 name
  truncation.**
- At every **C↔asm boundary** the asm `CSECT`/`ENTRY` name must equal the C
  alias character-for-character (`xq_push` `asm("NSFXPUSH")` ⇄ `NSFXPUSH CSECT`),
  so resolution never depends on the mangling rule.
- **Reviewer checklist (assembler/C):** a new non-static header function has a
  unique `asm()` alias; a new or renamed asm CSECT matches its C alias; a green
  host build is **not** evidence here — confirm no duplicate `PDPPRLG`/`ENTRY`
  symbols in the `cc370 -S` output (or a clean on-MVS link).

**C-callable HLASM (entry convention)**
- Every C-callable HLASM routine is built the **standard cc370 way** — `COPY
  MVSMACS` + `COPY PDPTOP`, `FUNHEAD` prologue, `FUNEXIT` epilogue (`FUNEXIT
  RC=(Rn)` when it returns a value in R15) — modeled on libc370
  `asm/@@getclk.asm`. **Never hand-roll `STM`/`BALR`/`USING`:** a hand-rolled
  seam omits the `ENTRY` / name eyecatcher / `LR R12,R15` base the cc370
  C-runtime path (`@@CRTGET`) relies on, and ABENDs the *next* C library call on
  MVS (S0C6) while it links and host-tests perfectly clean — a general
  mainline-runtime blocker (issue #8, proven by staged isolation).
- A **leaf** routine (issues no SVC/macro, calls nothing) uses the plain
  `FUNHEAD ,` form (like `nsf_now`). A routine that **issues an OS macro/SVC**
  (OPEN/CLOSE/EXCP/WTO/…) must give its callee a save area: use `FUNHEAD
  SAVE=name,US=NO` with a static `name DC 18F'0'` in the CSECT (single-task, so
  one shared static area is safe, per `nsfctcio.asm`) — **not** the leaf form.
- The `FUNHEAD` entry name IS the 8-char `asm()` alias, character for character.
  Address static data by **explicit displacement** `LABEL-entry(,R12)` (or a
  register), never a bare-label `USING` (as370 drops those to base 0 — the S102
  class). Address a **DSECT field** (IEZIOB/IHADCB) as a difference expression
  `FIELD-<origin>(Rn)`, never a bare `FIELD(Rn)`: as370 assembles a bare
  `FIELD(Rn)` with `disp = FIELD − (active USING base address)` instead of `disp
  = FIELD` — wrong for any USING base off the CSECT origin, e.g. every `FUNHEAD`
  entry after the first (a runtime-only wrong field, MVS-only; cc370 #18). Keep
  `CS`/`LM` (RS-format)
  operands `D(B)`, never `D(,B)` (#5). Keep every statement inside **column 71**:
  as370 reads column 72 as a continuation flag, so a **comment that overruns
  column 71 on an INSTRUCTION line** makes as370 treat the next line as a
  continuation and **silently drop the operand — or the whole instruction**. The
  M3-0b S0C1 was exactly this: an over-long comment on the `SVC 33` line dropped
  the `SVC 33` itself (and the save-area restore), so `ctci_halt_read` returned
  through garbage and branched to low storage. **A green host build and a clean
  cc370/as370/ld370 link are NOT evidence** — the merge is invisible off-target;
  only the live ABEND (or the `as370 -a=` listing) shows it. Keep
  instruction-line comments short and within column 71; put long rationale in a
  leading `*` comment block (those are full-width, whole-line comments and are
  safe).
- **Exception:** a routine the OS invokes as an *exit* (not called from C) is not
  a C callee and does not get `FUNHEAD` — e.g. `NSFTMEXP`, the STIMER exit.
- **Reviewer checklist (assembler):** a new C-callable routine uses
  `FUNHEAD`/`FUNEXIT`, not hand-rolled; its entry name matches its `asm()` alias;
  data addressed by explicit displacement; `CS`/`LM` stay `D(B)`; nothing past
  column 71. A green host build and a clean link are **not** evidence — this
  failure is MVS-runtime only (issue #8).

**Standard library truncation (libc370, ADR-0026)**
- `vsnprintf`/`snprintf` on libc370 do **NOT** NUL-terminate on truncation — a
  real glibc/C99 violation, pinned live by `TSTVSNP` (issue #25): `size` IS a
  hard write bound (not a memory-safety bug), but the target is filled solid
  through byte `size-1` with data, leaving no byte for a terminator; the
  return value is still the C99 "would-be length" regardless. **Never call
  `vsnprintf`/`snprintf` directly** — use `nsf_vsnprintf`/`nsf_snprintf`
  (`include/nsffmt.h`), which always NUL-terminate when `size > 0` and return
  the count of characters actually in the buffer (clamped), not the raw C99
  value.

**Contracts**
- `NSFRQE` (the app↔stack request block) **freezes at the M3 exit gate**.
  Changing it afterwards requires an ADR.

---

## 4. Naming Conventions

- **Component prefix:** `NSF`. **Subsystem (Phase 2):** `NSFS`.
- **Load modules / CSECTs:** `NSF` + up to 5 chars — `NSFMM`, `NSFBUF`,
  `NSFTCP`, `NSFCTCI`, …
- **Source files:** lowercase — `nsfmm.c`, `nsftcp.c`, `nsfctci.asm`,
  `nsfxq.asm`. One header per component in `include/`.
- **External C symbols:** every cross-module C function carries a unique 8-char
  `asm()` alias in its header, and asm CSECT names match that alias — see §3,
  "External symbols" (cc370 truncates externals to 8 chars).
- **Message IDs:** `NSFnnns` = `NSF` + 3-digit number + severity
  (`I`/`W`/`E`/`S`), e.g. `NSF001I NSF INITIALIZATION COMPLETE`.
  Number ranges: 000–099 executive · 100–199 memory/buffers · 200–299 devices
  · 300–399 IP/ICMP · 400–499 UDP · 500–599 TCP · 600–699 sockets/API ·
  700–799 config · 800–899 operator · 900–999 recovery.
- **External API keeps IBM names** at the boundary (`EZASOKET` entry point,
  PROFILE.TCPIP statement keywords). Compatibility outranks branding there.
- **Timed ECB waits (ADR-0025):** `ecb_timed_waitlist`'s timeout ECB wakes the
  WAIT only if it is **in** the waitlist — `nsfthr_timed_wait`/`nsfthr_join`
  wait on `{target, tmo|VL}`. Never test an ECB word for non-zero (a satisfied
  multi-ECB WAIT leaves an RB-address remnant in un-posted ECBs); test the
  POSTED bit.

---

## 5. Toolchain & Build

**Toolchain (decided — ADR-0013):**
- **C compiler:** `cc370` — complete host cross-compile suite. **Not**
  `c2asm370`.
- **C runtime:** `libc370` — the `cc370` **sysroot** (target C library),
  provided by the toolchain; **not** a `[dependencies]` entry (ADR-0014).
  **Not** `CRENT370`.
- **Assembler / linker:** IFOX00 / IEWL on the target (HLASM modules).
- **Build orchestration:** **MBT V2** (MVS Build Tools). Repo shape is an MBT
  project: `project.toml` at root; local MVS connection in an un-committed
  `.env` (from `.env.example`).

**Two build worlds, both driven by MBT (ADR-0014):**

| World | Builds | Compiler | Needs MVS? | Runs in CI? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Host (`make test-host`) | portable C + `nsf*_host.c` shims | native cc | No | **Yes** |
| MVS (`make test-mvs`, `deploy`, …) | full stack incl. `asm/*.asm` | cc370 + IFOX00 | Yes (live 3.8j over IP) | No |

Both are MBT V2 targets — there is **no** separate `host.mk`. The host build
is configured by the `[host]` table in `project.toml`; a `[host].replace`
map swaps each MVS-only CSECT (`asm/*.asm`) for its `src/*_host.c` shim.
Rules: `asm/*.asm` never compiles on host; everything else compiles both
ways; warnings-as-errors everywhere. The distinction between the worlds is
MVS reachability, not MBT vs. not-MBT.

**Commands (MBT V2 — real target names; `make help` for the full list):**
```
cp .env.example .env      # once: fill in MVS connection details
make test-host            # native build + run of the portable tests (no MVS)
make deps                 # resolve deps + allocate target datasets on MVS
make test-mvs             # deploy + run the tests on MVS
make modules              # cross-compile + assemble the load modules on MVS
make package              # TRANSMIT/XMIT the load library for download
make deploy               # upload modules + RECV370 on MVS
```
There is no `bootstrap`/`build`/`link` target (`deps` is the former
`bootstrap`). At M0-1 the project is module-less (test-only), so `modules`/
`package`/`deploy` become meaningful from M0-2/M1 onward.

**C dialect:** `-std=gnu99` (as set in `project.toml`), used conservatively —
no VLAs, no runtime allocation, fixed-width via the project typedefs
(`UCHAR/USHORT/UINT/INT`), big-endian S/370, AMODE 24 / RMODE 24, EBCDIC on
target. `cc370` accepted these flags on both host and MVS at M0-1; record any
later `cc370` limit surprises in an ADR. Comments and documentation in
**English**.

### Live MVS target & autonomous operation (`mvsdev`)

Operational runbook for driving the live target without a human in the loop.
The target is **MVSCE on Hercules on the host `mvsdev`** (`mvsdev.lan`).
Credentials live in the un-committed `.env` and the zowe `mvsdev` profile —
never hardcode them.

- **Build / deploy / test go over mvsMF REST (no SSH):** `make deps` (allocate
  datasets), `make deploy` (→ `NSF.LINKLIB`), `make modules`, `make test-mvs
  ARGS="--only TSTX"`. `test-mvs` writes the **full job spool to
  `build/test-runner.spool`** — read it for the actual `printf`/message output,
  not just the PASS/FAIL matrix. MBT honours **only `[build].cflags`** (no
  per-test cflags — `mbtconfig.py`), so a `-D`-gated device test is compiled in
  by adding the define to `[build].cflags` **temporarily** (revert before commit).
- **Console commands = ZOWE + the console log.** Issue any command with
  `zowe zos-console issue command "<cmd>"` (default profile `mvsdev`): `S NSF`,
  `F NSF,DISPLAY`, `P NSF`, `D U`, … **Direct output is unreliable** (often only
  the first message line returns), so read the full result from the
  Hercules-captured console log: `ssh mvsdev "grep -A6 '<marker>'
  ~/MVSCE/mvslog.txt"` (`mvslog.txt` is the complete MVS console/syslog).
  For a time-bounded view of recent messages use `zowe zos-logs list logs
  --range 15m` (last 15 minutes; also how you wait out the syslog LAG — see M1
  live-run rules). Grep the RIGHT reply IDs: STATS answers `NSF810/811I`, only
  DISPLAY answers `NSF800-802I`. When gauging egress on a CTCI ping, `LNK1 out`
  is the device-transmit counter; since the issue-#21 fix (ADR-0025 pair
  sequencing) it tracks `NSFIP out`/`NSFICM outecho` exactly — a lasting lag
  now indicates a real regression ([[nsf370-ctci-write-tail-stall]]).
- **`ssh mvsdev`** (host-side work: `tun0` captures, reading Hercules source,
  `/proc`) is hardened **keychain-independent** — on-disk `~/.ssh/id_rsa`,
  `IdentityAgent none`, `accept-new`, via the `mvsdev` block in `~/.ssh/config`
  (user `mike`). A **reinstall changes the host key** → self-heal with
  `ssh-keygen -R mvsdev` then reconnect. `ping` and `tcpdump` (cap_net_raw) run
  **without sudo**; **sudo needs a password we do not have**, so anything needing
  root must be asked of the user.
- **Hercules / CTCI on this box.** Config `~/MVSCE/conf/local/custom.cnf`; the
  **exact running Hercules source** is at `~/hercules/hyperion/` (read
  `ctc_ctci.c` etc. directly — primary source beats docs). The CTCI pair is
  `0500,0501 CTCI 192.168.200.1 192.168.200.2` on `tun0` (guest `.1` / host
  `.2`), CUU 500/501 online, 502/503 offline. To drive a CTCI device test, build
  with `-DNSFCTCI_CUU=0x0500 -DNSFCTCI_SRC=0xC0A8C801u -DNSFCTCI_DST=0xC0A8C802u`;
  the guest READ blocks until inbound traffic, so background a continuous
  `ssh mvsdev "ping -i 0.5 192.168.200.1"` to trigger it and `tcpdump -ni tun0
  icmp` to see the WRITE (`/proc/net/snmp` `Icmp InEchos` is a no-sudo
  WRITE-egress proxy).

## 6. Repository Layout (spec §16.2)

Flat layout (ADR-0014); the `nsf*` prefix namespaces every source, so no
per-layer subdirectories. Components stay grouped by prefix and the §9 map.

## 7. Milestone Status

Mirrors Notion (*Issues & Tasks*, project *mvs38j-ip (NSF)*). Update the Status
column as milestones progress. Every milestone's **Definition of Done** =
host Level 0/1 green in CI + the demonstrable deliverable shown on Hercules via
MBT `build`/`link` + **leak gate** (all pools back to baseline in-use after
quiesce) + spec/ADRs updated.

| MS | Scope | Exit gate | Status |
|----|-------|-----------|--------|
| **M0** | Foundation: MM, buffers, queues, timers, event loop, trace, stats, config, STC skeleton + ESTAE | `F NSF,DISPLAY,STATS` answers; clean stop, pools at baseline; CI green | ✅ **Complete** (host + cross-link + **on-MVS operator run VALIDATED live** on TK5) — M0-1 done (skeleton); M0-2 done (NSFQUE + NSFMM + nsf_abend); M0-3 done (NSFBUF: PBUF, headroom, chains, two-pool leak gate); M0-4 done (NSFTRC ring + NSFSTS registry + shared `nsftime` seam `nsf_now`/`nsf_taskid`, ADR-0016; TSTTRC 23/23, TSTSTS 23/23 host-green); M0-5 **done** (NSFTMR sorted delta queue + `nsfstim` STIMER seam; TSTTMR 43/43 host-green, 226/226 suite; ADR-0011 corrected **STIMERM→STIMER**; S102 seam bug fixed). **Issue #8 FIXED:** the hand-rolled C-callable HLASM seams (`nsftime`/`nsfxq`/`nsfstim`) are rebuilt on the standard cc370 entry convention (COPY MVSMACS + PDPTOP, FUNHEAD/FUNEXIT, per `@@getclk.asm`) — hand-rolled `STM/BALR/USING` was breaking the cc370 C-runtime (`@@CRTGET`, S0C6). Stage-2 isolation now **CC 0** (nsf_now + nsf_taskid, PSATOLD proven); `nsftime` VALIDATED. **ADR-0011 gate MET and FROZEN:** accuracy job on MVS = mean 100.1/100.2 ms, min/max 100 ms, jitter 0 ms (both criteria pass). `nsfxq`/`nsfstim` keep deferred-runtime status for M0-6 (entry convention fixed; xq handoff + async STIMER exit validated at M0-6). **M0-6 done** (NSFEVT event dispatcher / main loop per §5.3: WAIT-unless-pending → NSFXQ handoff drain → dispatch under a 64 drain budget → `nsftmr_run` → shutdown; the WAIT/POST seam is libc370 `ecb_waitlist` on MVS / a pthread cond-var host shim. **Timer wakeup = ADR-0017: the async STIMER REAL exit** — `NSFTMEXP` corrected to the documented MVS 3.8 exit linkage (GC28-0683) and **RUNTIME-VALIDATED**: TSTEVT 17/17 host-green (dispatch order, drain budget, pthread-simulated xq handoff, shutdown leak gate; 243/243 suite); TSTEVTM on MVS **CC 0**, 10 heartbeats at mean 100.2 ms, clean shutdown — the S0C6 is gone). **M0-7 done** (NSFCFG PROFILE.TCPIP parser + immutable fixed-size `NSFCFG` output struct per §14: `cfg_parse` (pure C over a buffer) + `cfg_load` (fopen/fread wrapper); DEVICE/LINK/HOME/GATEWAY/PORT/TCPCONFIG/UDPCONFIG + the `NSFPOOL`/`NSFTRACE` extensions; all-or-nothing validation rejecting on any error with an `NSF7xxE` message + 1-based line number, no partial config (eyecatcher stamped only on success), warn+continue for an explicit ignorable list. **Charset-transparent** (spec 15.3): compares char/string literals only + block-wise EBCDIC/ASCII-safe case fold — no hardcoded byte values — so the same source parses the ASCII host corpus and an EBCDIC PDS member. Referential integrity (LINK→DEVICE, HOME→LINK) deliberately **deferred to M0-8** (spec 14.2 is silent on the ordering/reference rules it would require). TSTCFG 111/111 host-green over a 14-file `test/cfg/` corpus (4 valid + 10 broken, one error class each, exact line asserted); **354/354 suite**, `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` clean; cross build: cc370 → 2 unique externals (`NSFCFPRS`/`NSFCFLDR`) → as370 assembles clean. **M0-8 done** (MVS STC skeleton — the `NSF` load module: config-driven init → §5.3 loop → `F NSF,DISPLAY/STATS/TRACE comp ON|OFF/STOP` + `P NSF` → orderly shutdown, under ESTAE. Operator = a **portable dispatcher** `nsfopr_dispatch` over a thin CIB/QEDIT seam; the loop's §5.3 **cibECB slot** is filled by `evt_set_operator`, whose drain runs **unconditionally** each pass — the `IEE342I TASK BUSY` startup-CIB trap from ufsd. **NSFCFG→init wiring** `nsf_init_from_cfg`: NSFTRACE→`nsftrc_flags`, NSFPOOL→`buf_init_counts`, and the M0-7-deferred **referential integrity** (LINK→DEVICE, HOME/GATEWAY→LINK; `NSF720/721/722E`). Recovery + WTO reuse **libc370** (`__estae` + C `nsf_recover` percolating via `SDWARCDE=SDWACWT`; `wto`) — **ADR-0018**, maintainer-ratified; **no** `nsfestae.asm`/`nsfwto.asm` (a raw asm→C recovery bridge re-implements `@@estae` = issue-#8 class); M0-8 adds **zero** new asm.

COND CODE 0000`, SYSUDUMP DD empty (no dump, verified from the full spool). `test/mvs/tststcm.c` covers ESTAE establish/delete; the induced-ABEND→percolate path was not force-run (leaves a dump). **M0 COMPLETE. M1 (CTCI driver + NSFDEV + NSFHOST) next.**) |
| **M1** | CTCI driver (HLASM top / C bottom) + NSFDEV + NSFHOST | ping → hexdump in trace; crafted packet seen in host `tcpdump` | ✅ **Complete** — **M1-1 done** (CTCI wire format verified byte-exact vs Hercules `ctc_ctci.c`, written into spec §9.3 as normative: 3088 read/write pair, `CTCIHDR`/`CTCISEG`, big-endian). **M1-2 done** (device abstraction + host driver): `include/nsfdev.h`/`src/nsfdev.c` — the `DEVOPS` contract + fixed device table (`dev_register`/`dev_find`/`dev_find_cuu`/`dev_by_index`/`dev_foreach`/`dev_start`/`dev_send`/`dev_shutdown`), `NETDEV` 64 B (`NSF_SIZE_ASSERT`), `send`-ownership rule enforced. The executive loop stays **driver-agnostic** (never names HOST/CTCI): `NSFDEV` registers three hooks via `evt_set_devices` (mirroring `evt_set_operator`) — `nsfdev_collect_ecbs` (device ECBs→ECBLIST), `nsfdev_poll_input` (drain each `doneq`→`EV_PACKET_RECEIVED`, before dispatch, lost-wakeup-safe ECB clear, drop+count on EVT exhaustion), `nsfdev_kick_output` (§5.3 step 5); `nsfevt_wake` kicks output for a send from outside a loop pass. **NSFHOST** (`src/nsfhost.c`, host-only): `DEVOPS` impl whose inbound path is the **host analog of the CTCI I/O-completion exit** — a pthread reader thread `xq_push`es a received PBUF onto `doneq` + POSTs the device ECB, so the `doneq→EV_PACKET_RECEIVED` handoff is validated across a real thread boundary (M1-3 swaps only the producer). Default in-memory **loopback** (copy-free relay; NSFMM touched only on the executive task → no pool race), optional **TUN** (`-DNSFHOST_TUN`), **PCAP** reserved. Cross-build discipline: `nsfhost.c` is host-only, the MVS build compiles the NULL-ops placeholder `src/nsfhost_plat.c` (no host driver on MVS — use CTCI/LCS) swapped via `[host].replace`, so `test/tstdev.c` (portable; pthread lives in nsfhost.c) still cross-links and skips trivially where `nsfhost_ops()` is NULL. Host **408→488** (TSTDEV 80: send→receive cycle, in-order delivery, bounded `sendq`, DOWN-device reject, leak gate; 80/80 stress-stable); `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` clean (host + cc370); NSF module + all 16 test modules cross-link clean, alias scan clean (unique `NSFD*`/`NSFH*`/`NSFEVDEV`/`NSFEVWK`). ADR-0018/spec §9.2/§9.4/§19 updated. **M1-3 done** (CTCI top half + C lifecycle, per **ADR-0019** — plain `EXCP`, IOS posts the IOB ECB, **no** I/O-completion exit and **no** appendage): `asm/nsfctcio.asm` (six C-callable FUNHEAD entries — `ctci_scb_size`/`ctci_open_sub`/`ctci_read`/`ctci_write`/`ctci_status`/`ctci_close_sub`; the OPEN/CLOSE/EXCP-issuing ones use `FUNHEAD SAVE=`, not the leaf form; DCB/IOB fields addressed as `FIELD-<origin>(Rn)` difference expressions to dodge an as370 bug (cc370 #18: a bare `FIELD(Rn)` gets `disp = FIELD − active-USING-base`); file named `nsfctcio` because mbt derives the object name from the source basename and `nsfctci.asm` would collide with `src/nsfctci.c`). `src/nsfctci.c` — reserve NSFMM init-window pools (CTCIDEV/CTCISCB/CTCIBUF), SVC 99 allocate the CUU pair via the libc370 seam (`DALUNIT` from the DEVICE-statement CUU, system-returned DDNAME `DALRTDDN`, `DALSTATS` SHR), open both subchannels, start/decode/close raw EXCP; `NSF2xxE` on failure (refuse-to-start), unallocate on close. `include/nsfctci.h` (`CTCIDEV` 64 B `NSF_SIZE_ASSERT`, `CTCIHDR`/`CTCISEG` wire structs, 14 unique `NSFCI*` aliases). `test/mvs/tstctcm.c` (host=false). **PROVEN:** host 488/488 unchanged; cc370/as370/ld370 cross-link clean (NSF module + all 17 test modules); alias scan clean; and — **run live on TK5** (`test-mvs` TSTCTCM CC 0 batch+TSO, 6/6) — the **SVC 99 seam end-to-end** over our `svc99_call` wrapper: FAILURE (`ZZZZ` → `rc=4 S99ERROR=021C`, `__svc99` standard-linkage confirmed, no S0C6) **and SUCCESS** (a device-free DUMMY allocation → `S99VRBAL rc 0`, generated DDNAME `SYS00007` reaches our buffer, `S99VRBUN rc 0`, no stray DD); plus the **full `ctci_dev_open` lifecycle** (reserve the 3 NSFMM pools on 3.8j, `mm_alloc`, `%04X`, SVC 99 of the numeric undefined CUU `0E20`, the `NSF202E` WTO on the console, refuse-to-start → NULL, cleanup) — everything ctci_dev_open does except the channel I/O. **EXCP path VALIDATED live on MVSCE** (issue #16, real Hercules CTCI pair CUU 500/501 on `tun0`): `test-mvs` TSTCTCM **CC 0, 12/12** — SVC 99 allocated devices 500/501 (two distinct DDNAMEs), OPEN, EXCP **WRITE** post `X'7F'` (crafted ICMP echo seen in host `tcpdump`, id `0xABCD`), EXCP **READ** post `X'7F'` (length = requested − IOB residual; block walked to 227 well-formed `CTCISEG`s). **Two fixes fell out (ADR-0020):** the SVC 99 unit name is **3 hex digits not 4** (`%04X`→`%03X`; a 4-digit CUU is undefined = `S99ERROR 021C`, which had made the old `0E20` wall-probe a false positive — see [[nsf370-device-number-width]]), and **§9.3's READ framing was wrong** (one block of `CTCISEG`s, leading `hwOffset` = end-of-data, Hercules does NOT transfer the `0x0000` terminator to the guest, `hwType` a constant `0x0800` marker; the WRITE framing was correct). Deferred-seam labels removed from `asm/nsfctcio.asm`+`src/nsfctci.c`; the `CTCISAVE`/ESTAE item-3 constraint is now a source comment. **M1-4 done (incl. M1-4b, issue #18 / ADR-0022+0023) — M1 exit gate MET, validated live in the STC.** The C bottom half: the **codec** `src/nsfctcif.c` (CTCISEG↔raw-IP, byte-wise big-endian; TSTCTCIF 37/37 on literal §9.3 vectors), the **portable bottom half** `src/nsfctcib.c` (DEVOPS + the repurposed DEVIO seam + the two **I/O subtask functions** read_sub/write_sub; TSTCTCI 44/44 over the host thread+channel shims, run as real pthreads), the **channel/SVC 99 split** (`ctci_chan_alloc/unalloc`, executive-side) and the new **`nsfthr` threading seam** (libc370 `cthread` on MVS / pthread on host — the SAME subtask logic runs both ways; de-risked in ISOLATION first: **TSTCTHR** CC 0 on MVS — a subtask SVC-2 POST into the executive's multi-ECB WAIT wakes it 20/20 alongside the STIMER heartbeat, termecb join + detach, ESTAE-isolated subtask fault; prerequisite: unauthorized NSF must call `clib_identify_cthread()` itself, since libc370 only IDENTIFYs CTHREAD inside the authorized `clib_apf_setup`). **Completion model (ADR-0022/0023):** the executive WAITs ONLY on `dev->ecb` and CLEARS it before each service (a lingering posted ECB in the multi-ECB WAIT is the #18 hazard); each subchannel is OWNED by its subtask (OPEN+EXCP+CLOSE on one TCB, so its CLOSE purges its own EXCP — this forced a **per-scb save area** in `asm/nsfctcio.asm`: the shared static `CTCISAVE` was corrupted by concurrent subtask calls → live S238); READ is **single-block-synchronous** (ONE buffer + a `returnecb` handshake; the executive decodes raw blocks into PBUFs — the doneq payload is raw blocks, NOT subtask-allocated PBUFs, because NSFMM is deliberately unserialised, §3; ping-pong is the documented throughput follow-on); WRITE is one-outstanding (executive encodes into wbuf, subtask EXCPs, executive reaps + frees the PBUF exactly once). `nsfthr` waits use `ecb_(timed_)waitlist` with a SEPARATE timeout ECB — `cthread_wait` CLEARS the ECB and `ecb_timed_wait` POSTs it on timeout, either losing or forging a completion; a join timeout RETAINS (never detaches) a live subtask. **Idle liveness = the ADR-0017 heartbeat armed at STC start** (`nsftmr_plat_arm(1)` in nsfmain.c): a timed executive WAIT is disqualified because `ecb_timed_waitlist` TTIMER-CANCELs the calling task's interval timer (**STIMER is a per-task singleton**) and its timeout does not fire on the CRT main task (ADR-0023 §6; consequence: `nsfthr_timed_wait/join` run on the executive only outside the heartbeat window — start before arm, teardown after disarm). `CTCIDEV` 68→108 (`NSF_SIZE_ASSERT`); host suite **569** (TSTCTCI rewritten for the subtask model); cross-link + alias scan clean (new `NSFTH*`, `NSFCIALC`/`NSFCIUNA`). **Validated live on MVSCE** (STC on the real pair 0500/0501): `S NSF` → SVC 99 + both subtasks OPEN (`NSF210I/211I`); host ping → reads decoded on the executive (`ctr_in` 0→59→86) + **RX hexdump in the trace ring**; **`F NSF,STATS` prompt in EVERY state** — fresh idle, during reads (the exact operation #18 hung), and post-traffic idle; **MIH across idle tolerated** (IGF991I/995I, device kept working after the I/O restart); **`P NSF` → NSF830I→NSF011I→IEF404I within one second**, subtasks joined (termecb), **SYSUDUMP empty (0 bytes)**; the crafted ICMP echo id `0xABCD` on the host wire in `tcpdump` (TSTCTCM, whose part 2 also proved the isolated subtask path batch CC 0, 11/11, incl. a MULTI-ECB-WAIT mini-loop — never again a single-ECB probe, which was the #18 blind spot). Live-run rules that each cost real time: MVSCE syslog LAGS — wait before reading (`zowe zos-logs list logs --range Nm`); grep the RIGHT reply IDs (STATS answers `NSF810/811I`, only DISPLAY answers `NSF800-802I`); background pings on mvsdev need `setsid` + on-wire verification (`tcpdump`), else a zombie ping fakes an idle-hang; TSTCTCM part 2 is a SINGLE-SHOT batch probe (the TSO re-run against the same physical pair back-to-back stalls MIH-pending — a live-hardware re-use artifact, not a driver bug). **M1 COMPLETE** (gate: ping → RX hexdump in trace; crafted packet in host `tcpdump`). LCS + ARP remain M6. **M2 (IPv4/ICMP) next.** |
| **M2** | IPv4 in/out + routing + ICMP echo/errors + checksum | `ping <mvs-ip>` sustained, 0 loss on loopback link | ✅ **Complete.** M2-1: `in_cksum` (RFC 1071) over a **PBUF chain** — word parity relative to `off` so a word straddling an ODD segment boundary is summed right (`src/nsfcksum.c`, alias `NSFCKSUM`; TSTCKSUM 10/10 on literal RFC/IP-header vectors, pinned before any packet code, spec 11.5). M2-2: **NSFIP** (`src/nsfip.c`) `nsfip_input` (validate v4/IHL/len/header-cksum; drop+count fragment→`fragdrop`, not-for-us→`inaddrerr`, bad cksum→`badcksum`, bad ver/IHL→`hdrerr`, bad len→`badlen`; demux ICMP, `noproto` TCP/UDP stubs; **TTL parsed but NOT a delivery gate** — RFC 1122 §3.2.1.7, `ttlexp` stays 0) + `nsfip_output` (build header in the PBUF headroom, monotonic id, computed cksum, route, `dev_send`) + fixed 16-entry **routing table** from HOME (classful on-link) + GATEWAY (default), longest-match, next-hop 0 = the point-to-point peer (`nsfip_config`/`nsfip_route_add`/`nsfip_local_add`/`nsfip_is_local`/`nsfip_route`; ADR-0024). **Every header field read/written BYTE BY BYTE** (big-endian), never a struct overlay/cast; addresses are `UINT`s (octet-1 in MSB) — the CTCI-codec discipline (green-and-wrong on the little-endian host otherwise). M2-3: **NSFICM** (`src/nsficmp.c`) echo responder in **the same PBUF** — verify ICMP cksum, flip type 8→0, recompute, strip IP header (opens exactly the headroom `nsfip_output` re-prepends), `nsfip_output` with src/dst swapped; `icmp_outecho` counted only on output success (ownership + counter never double up); non-echo/bad-cksum counted + freed. Seam wired: STC `EV_PACKET_RECEIVED`→`nsfip_input`; startup calls `nsficmp_init`+`nsfip_config` AFTER interfaces register (`src/nsfmain.c`). Host **569→641** (TSTCKSUM 10; TSTIP 39 — capture-DEVOPS + literal vectors + leak gate; TSTICMP 23 — NSFHOST-loopback echo round-trip with a verified reply + bad-cksum drop + leak gate); `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` clean; NSF module cross-links clean (cc370/as370/ld370), alias scan clean (11 new unique exports `NSFIP*`/`NSFICM*`/`NSFCKSUM`, statics ENTRY=NO). §11.1/11.4/11.7 + ADR-0024 + changelog v1.19 updated. **VALIDATED LIVE on MVSCE** (STC 165, real CTCI pair 0500/0501): `S NSF`→`NSF210I/211I` up; host `ping 192.168.200.1` **the from-scratch NSF stack answers** (`ttl=64`, ~1 ms RTT), counters exact — over 1000 packets `NSFIP in/out`, `NSFICM inecho/outecho` **all 1000**, every drop counter 0. Two things fell out of the live gate: (a) **a write-completion clear-race, FIXED** — the executive reap read+cleared the write subtask's IOB ECB `wecb` while the subtask polled it, stealing the completion and stalling the write pipeline after ONE frame (the read path never had this: the read subtask owns `recb`, hands up `rpost`/`rready`); fix makes write symmetric (`wpost`/`wready`, executive never touches `wecb`; CTCIDEV 108→112; TSTCTCI sustained-write regression, 44→168). (b) the last-frame-of-burst stall, initially misread as a completion-wake issue — resolved at **issue #21**, below. Host **765/765**; TSTCKSUM/TSTIP/TSTICMP also **CC 0 on-MVS** (112/112, target byte-order proven). **Issue #21 FIXED (ADR-0025) — the M2 0-loss gate is now CLEAN.** Three separately-proven defects: (1) `nsfthr_timed_wait`/`nsfthr_join` passed `ecb_timed_waitlist` a timeout ECB NOT in the WAIT ECBLIST — the STIMER exit posted a dead stack ECB, so the "timed" wait never timed out (the CTCI 500 ms self-poll was dead code; ADR-0023 §6's "timeout does not fire on the CRT main task" was this bug misdiagnosed). Fixed: WAIT on `{target, tmo|VL}`, target ECB never cleared/phantom-posted; proven both ways by MVS-only **TSTTHRW** (old shape hangs 2 s+ until a real post; fixed fires at 500 ms on a subtask AND the main task; a join of a live subtask times out to RETAIN). (2) The §5.3 WAIT-skip never rechecked device work after the `dev->ecb` reset: `DEVIO` gains a side-effect-free `pending` probe (CTCI: `rready || (wready && txbusy)`, mirroring service's consume conditions) + `nsfdev_work_pending` (`NSFDPEND`) as a 4th `evt_set_devices` hook, consulted before the WAIT commit (host-proven with no timer running: a destroyed-wake completion reaps the same pass). (3) **The transport mechanism, isolated live after (1)+(2) deployed:** a WRITE SIO issued while the blocking READ is outstanding **queues at the IOS level (shared channel) until the next inbound frame completes that READ** — slow replies tracked the sender's interval exactly (505 ms at `-i 0.5`, 2020 ms at `-i 2`; the earlier "bimodal 200-311 ms band" was that run's ping interval, and Hercules `ctc_ctci.c` holds no lock across its read wait, so the queueing is above the device handler), and with no next frame the tail stalled forever. Fixed by **pair sequencing**: `service` marks the read release (`CTCIDEV.rhold`, 112 B unchanged), `kick` posts `returnecb` only when no WRITE is queued or outstanding — every WRITE issues with the READ parked; the un-armed window is lossless (Hercules buffers, §9.3); PBUF ownership + the kick-clocked handoff unchanged; `kick` also walks past dropped frames instead of stranding the sendq. **M3+ constraint:** a locally-originated WRITE while the READ is armed still queues — HIO or an attention-driven read protocol must land before the first M3 transmit path (documented in ADR-0025; the ping-pong throughput follow-on is conditional on the same solution). **Gate proven live** (MVSCE, real pair 0500/0501): 1000-packet ping → **1000/1000, 0 % loss, unimodal** (min/avg/max 0.550/0.918/35.1 ms, p99 < 1 ms, zero ≥ 100 ms, last frame 0.899 ms); `LNK1 in 1006 == LNK1 out 1006`, all drops 0; `P NSF` → NSF830I→NSF011I→IEF404I same-second. Host **804/804** (TSTCTCI 168→207: destroyed-wake reap, loop-consults-probe, rhold ordering); on-MVS regression **188 PASS** batch+TSO (TSTTHRW/TSTCTHR/TSTEVTM/TSTSTCM/TSTCKSUM/TSTIP/TSTICMP/TSTTMACC). Spec v1.20 (§5.3/§9.3) + ADR-0025 + ADR-0023 annotation. **M2-4/M2-5 DONE — M2 COMPLETE.** M2-4: `nsficmp_send_error` (`src/nsficmp.c`, alias `NSFICMSE`) builds the ICMP error in a FRESH PBUF (orig stays read-only/single-owner) — new IP header + ICMP type/code header quoting orig's IP header + first 8 payload bytes (RFC 792), checksummed once; suppressed per RFC 1122 §3.2.2 (error-on-error, broadcast/multicast dest, non-initial fragment, non-unicast source), no counter for a suppressed send (spec 11.7 has none). Only ONE trigger is live in v1: `nsfip_input`'s existing `noproto` path now also calls `nsficmp_send_error(orig, 3, 2)` (protocol unreachable) — port unreachable and TTL exceeded are fully built but intentionally uncalled until M4 sockets / a forward path exist (§11.2 documents why). M2-5 found the §11.7 counters + NSFTRC wiring already in place from M2-1..3; the gap was test coverage — every IP counter (incl. `out`/`noproto`/`ttlexp`==0) now reads back by name, plus a dedicated flag-on/flag-off trace test. `test/tsticmp.c` gained a CAPTURE-device scenario for the live trigger (byte-exact decode) and direct-call scenarios per suppression rule (nsfip_input's own demux filters 3 of the 4 cases before the noproto trigger, so send_error is exercised directly — with the capture route still wired so a broken guard would be caught, not silently pass). Host **804→861** (TSTICMP 23→66, TSTIP 39→53); cross-link + alias scan clean (`NSFICMSE`, no collisions). **Both live checks proven on MVSCE** (STC, real pair 0500/0501): a raw protocol-253 datagram from the host draws `ICMP ... protocol 253 unreachable` in `tcpdump` (quoting the original exactly), `errsent`/`noproto` 0→1; `F NSF,STATS` after a 20-packet 0%-loss ping shows every counter populated and consistent; `P NSF` clean same-second, no dump. Spec v1.21 (§11.2/§11.7 + changelog). **M2 COMPLETE. M3 (sockets + NSFRQE + UDP + EZASOKET) next.** |
| **M3** | Sockets + NSFRQE + UDP + EZASOKET (M3 set) | UDP echo via EZASOKET from host; leak-free. **`NSFRQE` freezes here.** | ◐ **M3-0 COMPLETE** (the CTCI locally-originated-write prerequisite the M2 gate left open). **M3-0a** (Stage 0, issue proven, ADR-0027 grounding): `test/mvs/tsthio.c` + `test/asm/tsthalt.asm` proved live that a PROBLEM-STATE program can halt an outstanding CTCI READ — IOHALT (SVC 33) *and* PURGE (SVC 16) both fire from problem state with no abend, and the guest-visible completion is **X'48'** (purged; the post code, NOT the residual, is the discriminator); a fresh READ re-arms cleanly. **M3-0b done — IOHALT active read-park (ADR-0027):** the write-kick actively parks the armed READ by IOHALT-ing it (UCB chased DCB+44→DEB+32 + UCBNAME-checked, cached at init; `NSFCIHLT` in `asm/nsfctcio.asm` uses `FUNHEAD SAVE=<static>` — executive-only caller, and a type-2 SVC needs the proper save-area linkage; the S0C1 that fell out first was a **column-72 continuation merge** dropping the `SVC 33`, CLAUDE.md §3 re-pinned). Its wait completes X'48' (purged) or X'7F' (a raced frame) → the ADR-0025 `rhold` path → WRITE issues → `returnecb` re-arms. **Three read-completion classes** + **counter split**: `ierr` = genuine device errors + resource exhaustion only; new CTCI-private `nonip` (non-IPv4/malformed codec drops) and `rpurge` (purged reads). `CTCIDEV` 112→**124 B**. Host **875→906** (TSTCTCI +31: halt-park / halt-data race / counter classes). **VALIDATED LIVE on MVSCE** (real 0500/0501): *locally-originated* — TSTCTCM CC 0 batch+TSO, on a truly idle link (`in_delta=0`) the crafted echo reached the wire with **`out=1 rpurge=1 ierr=0`** (old code would stall until the next inbound frame); *regression* — `S NSF` device up (UCB chased clean), host 1000-ping **1000/1000 0 % loss** unimodal 0.516/0.898/1.608 ms, `LNK1 in 1019 == out 1019`, all drops 0, **`rpurge 0`** across the run (receive→reply never halts — the halt fires only for locally-originated writes), `F NSF,STATS` shows the new counters, `P NSF` clean same-second, no dump. Spec v1.23 §9.3 + ADR-0027. **M3-1 done — NSFSOC socket object model + the
NSFRQE frozen contract.** Protocol-independent socket machinery, host-tested end
to end over a **test-only dummy PROTOPS** (direct calls, no event loop, no real
transport, **no new MVS seam** — sockets are not yet reachable, so there is no
live feature gate). `include/nsfreq.h`: `NSFRQE` **defined complete now** as the
phase-boundary contract (64 B core, `NSF_SIZE_ASSERT`, pool objsize 96, eye
`"RQE "`), Phase-2 fields (`ubuf`/`ulen` + SOCKCB `owner_ascb`) present so the
layout is stable for M5; `RQ_*` fn codes, `RQ_F_NONBLOCK`, and the EZASOKET
`NSF_E*` errno set (IBM/BSD numbering matching libc370, `NSF_`-prefixed to never
collide with `<errno.h>`, marked provisional — only the LAYOUT freezes, not
`errno_`). `include/nsfsoc.h` / `src/nsfsoc.c`: SOCKCB (72 B, `NSF_SIZE_ASSERT`,
≤128), the `SOCKET` pool reserved in the init window (no runtime
`mm_pool_create`), `sock_alloc` (EMFILE) / `sock_lookup` (gen-checked → EBADF on
stale/reused) / `soc_desc`, the `PROTOPS` vtable + `soc_dispatch` (pure
mechanism — invokes the op, never auto-completes; EOPNOTSUPP for a NULL op,
EINVAL for an unknown fn), the parked-request pattern (`soc_park`/`soc_complete`;
non-blocking → EWOULDBLOCK; a parked NSFRQE is socket-owned until completed), and
**`soc_destroy`** — the ONE teardown checklist (detach → flush rxq/acceptq PBUFs
→ complete every parked NSFRQE with `NSF_ECONNABORTED` → release pcb → **bump the
SLOT generation** → `mm_free`) every close/reset/shutdown path calls.
**Refinement (spec §10.2, v1.24):** the generation lives in the **table slot**,
not only the SOCKCB, or §10.5's "bump gen, mm_free" is a no-op and a reused slot
would hand back an old descriptor; SOCKCB.gen is a mirror. **`soc_complete`'s
app-ecb POST is a same-AS plain POST over the existing thread seam**
(`nsfthr_post`, real SVC 2 on MVS) — NOT `nsfevt_plat_post` (which only sets the
bit on MVS and would never wake an app task WAITing solely on `rqe->ecb`);
cross-AS wakeup stays M5/Phase 2 (ADR-0022), NSF stays unauthorized/problem-
state. **NSFRQE freezes at the M3 exit gate.** Host **906→979** (TSTSOC **73**:

| **M4** | TCP (state machine, data path, rexmit) + EZASOKET (M4 set) + loss harness | telnet TCP echo, clean FIN, survives 5% loss; TIME_WAIT reclaim shown | ☐ Planned |
| **M5** | Phase 2: `NSFS` subsystem + cross-memory + TCP hardening + docs | 2 address spaces share one stack; stress passes; docs complete | ☐ Planned |
| **M6** | *(stretch)* HTTPD + mvsMF on NSF; DNS; LCS + ARP | **Project success:** HTTPD & mvsMF run unchanged (relink) on TK4-/TK5 | ☐ Planned |

Critical path: **M0-1** (MBT project + build) and **M0-2** (NSFQUE/NSFMM);
the rest of M0 parallelizes. M5 carries the only real schedule risk and is
isolated so M0–M4 already deliver a usable in-process stack.

## 8. Working Agreement (per task)

1. **Read** this file → the spec chapter for the component → referenced ADRs.
   Do not infer behavior the spec fixes; if the spec is silent, propose an ADR.
2. **Host-test first.** Write Level 0/1 tests with the native compiler before
   (or alongside) the implementation. They must stay runnable without MVS.
3. **Respect the invariants in §3.** Especially: no allocation on hot paths,
   single-owner buffers, one destroy function per object, `NSF_SIZE_ASSERT` on
   every CB, ESTAE coverage, and an 8-char `asm()` alias on every cross-module
   function (asm CSECT names match).
4. **On-MVS validation** via `make test-mvs` at milestone boundaries and
   before merging anything touching `asm/*.asm`.
5. **Definition of Done** (§7) must hold, including the leak gate.
6. **Keep docs honest:** when a decision changes, update the affected spec
   chapter and add/append an ADR in the same change. Update §7 status here.
7. **English** for all code comments, commit messages, and docs.
